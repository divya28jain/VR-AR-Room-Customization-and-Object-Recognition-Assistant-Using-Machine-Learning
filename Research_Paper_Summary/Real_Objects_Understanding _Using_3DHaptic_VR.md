## Problem Statement
- In e-learning, explaining 2D objects is easy, but understanding 3D real-world objects is difficult.
- Traditional methods (blackboards, projectors, online classes) lack depth perception and interaction.
- Manual 3D modeling via CAD is costly and time-consuming.
- The challenge: How to make 3D objects accessible, interactive, and affordable for online education?

## Technologies and Methods Used
- **Computer Vision & Image Processing**
  - Edge detection, silhouette extraction, filters for object boundary estimation.
- **Machine Learning**
  - 2.5D feature extraction: silhouette, depth, surface normals.
  - Depth estimation using CNN (SENet-154) trained on NYU v2 dataset.
- **3D Reconstruction**
  - Mesh generation via ellipsoidal deformation + CNN.
  - Bounding box estimation for object placement in VR.
- **Virtual Reality + Haptic Sensors**
  - VR integration for immersive learning.
  - Haptic feedback for tactile interaction with 3D objects.

## Limitations & Future Work
- Works best with synthetic images (limited performance on complex real-world backgrounds).
- HoG features are not effective for objects (only good for human detection).
- Future improvements:
  - Extend to human body/face 3D modeling.
  - Apply deep learning with multi-view datasets for higher accuracy.
